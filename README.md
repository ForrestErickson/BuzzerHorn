# BuzzerHorn
A BuzzerHorn to Fit a Piezo Transducter, 12.2mm x 6.5mm on the GPAD.  
A FreeCad project.  

### Tagged Version Descriptions
I have made several guesses at shapes to try each time making tweeks for fit to GPAD Version 1 PCB.

Version 3.0

Version 3.0 Reduce top diamter to about 0.6 inch so will not interfer with LED D201 on GPAD.

Version 2.0
